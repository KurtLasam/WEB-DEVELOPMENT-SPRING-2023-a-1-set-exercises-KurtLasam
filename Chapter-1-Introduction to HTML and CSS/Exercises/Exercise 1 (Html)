     <h1> Filipino Dish "Picadillo"</h1>
<body>
    <!--This part of the body explains the origins of Giniling-->
    <p>Giniling is the Tagalog term for ground meat. What chili is to Americans, giniling is to most Filipinos.
         Its one of the simplest Filipino dishes, yet is bursting with beautiful pinoy flavors.</p>

        Its their ultimate comfort food that they grew up eating for weeknight meals or sharing with large crowds during special celebration times.</p>

        <p>Traditionally, giniling is made with ground pork, but many love to make it with ground beef, 
            and its not that rare to see some ground chicken version of the same dish.</p>

            <p>Ground pork along with loads of veggies is simmered in a delicious tomato based sauce until all the flavors mingle together to create an amazingly delicious dish.</p>
